Best Buy,Inventory Specialist,"Flexible hours, you get to learn a lot of new things and the people around you are pretty nice, at least the location i worked at was. A lot of the benefits they advertised while recruiting were for full timer's and best buy is stingy with offering full time positions. Management is not organized and is poor at listening.'",TRUE
Best Buy,Geeksquad Agent,Lots of hands on experience. A lots of potential in moving up. If you want anything to change in the environment you really have to push for it and be persistent. A lot of higher ups believe their way is the best way.',TRUE
Best Buy,Sales Consultant,"Meet a lot of new people, learn new skills, good way to get out of comfort zone. Pay is low, managers are always out of work and changing.'",FALSE
Best Buy,Assistant Manager,Best buy empowers employees and really cares about their experience. Irregular schedule. Very high business goals.',TRUE
Best Buy,Sales Associate,"Not a bad employee discount. Impossible goals that are wired to make employees thirst-driven lying snakes, that makes you want to take a shower after every day at the job. Why we are taught and trained to be bad human beings in order to trick other people I don't know. Just because other retail stores do this (not all, but the majority) does not make it a good practice, and Best Buy should set themselves higher, but they are living in the past. The only reason customers will continue to shop at Best Buy is if employees are earnestly trying to help them and not trying to upsell. They will go to Amazon and other places instead because being at Best Buy is like akin to being at a car dealership. Adapt and change with the times.'",FALSE

Target,Cashier,"They do huddle's during shifts which is nice sometimes. Very team oriented and there were many people to talk to in order to discuss any issues you were having. Very lenient with the hours you need to work. In the clothes department, the team lead almost never got anything done. They would spend more time checking on everyone else than actually doing their own work. If someone didn't show up then the employees who were there had to make up for the sections of the floor that weren't being covered and that wasn't fair at all. Advice to Mangement: Take the time to properly train employees and work more nights. Without the proper training employees feel overwhelmed and they don't want to stay. Very frustrating for employees to stay.'",FALSE
Target,Sales Associate,Good rewards for doing your job. Not enough hours for consistent pay.',FALSE
Target,N/A,"You can make some great connections with co-workers. Great FMLA benefits though for managers (at least). I felt supported during my leave and welcomed back after my child was born. Your training videos and what you are taught about the culture is watered down by the time it reaches the store level. Oh yeah and don't get caught being a woman, you'll make less than your male counterparts :/ Why do managers play favorites and bully? Life's tough enough and we spend so much time at work; can't you make it a nice experience?'",FALSE

AT&T,Senior Solutions Architect,"Flexible work arrangements, highly supportive colleagues, decent work/life balance. There are still some in Senior Management who believe that an employee needs to be in Texas to advance his or her career. Technology is what made AT&T great. More focus and investment into core technology to deliver services better faster and cheaper than anyone else will lead to continued long term success. Investing in content is a gamble.'",TRUE
AT&T,Vendor Management,Tremendous growth opportunity if you're in the right place. It is easy to get lost in the shuffle of reorgs. Trying to keep ahead of the surplus and manage career growth is difficult. Management should Figure out a way to not surplus high performing leaders. You are letting talent get away from you.',TRUE

Amazon,Warehouse Associate,"Great medical benefits, monthly bonuses, stock incentive, casual work environment, diverse people. Pretty cool place to work, freebies for performers. And did I mention the cool people! 3 day weekends, overtime available.. easy interview process. Pass the screening online and if you're asked to come for and interview you got the job as long as you pass the mouth swab drug test and background check. Regarding background just be honest on in your app, they are pretty flexible. Someone will call you to verify and then you're good! Pay could be higher. Long work days- sometimes 10-12 hours, average day 10 hrs. Depending on department- sometimes it's very boring and repetitive or very exhausting and very physical. Still worth it. Management needs to increase pay, reward top performers with individual productivity bonuses instead of blanket site productivity (VCP).'

Bank of America,Senior Product Manager,"Experience working across lines of business in a matrix environment, global company experience. Unreasonable work/life balance, the epitome of the ""good ole boy"" network, extreme lack of diversity at mid level management and even more scarce at the senior and c-suite levels. Management needs to Value employees for their diverse talent and perspectives. Too many senior leaders set in thinking one way, because they've been at the bank for 15+ years. Minority employees are leaving at an alarming rate, due to the disparate treatment from leadership. The bank needs to take a hard look at their talent pipeline and recruiting strategy, or else they will continue losing amazing talent to competitors who treat their employees better. Bank of America purports that they're serious about Diversity & Inclusion, but only to give the public that impression and only focuses on one diversity factor: women. There are so many more facets of diversity and they need to be considered. I would not recommend leadership continuing this trend if BAC wants to remain competitive in our ever-diversifying economy.

Bank of America,Business Solutions Consultant,"Good Pay and Multiple Benefit choices. Under constant downsizing effort. You never know when the ax will fall but it falls for everyone eventually.

Constantly cutting and replacing with new, cheaper talent isn't the best way to get the work done efficiently.'",FALSE
Bank of America,Financial Center Operations Manager,"Now that I have interviewed at other companies (Banks) I actually have no pros. Vacation time is based on years at BOA and many other Banks offer PTO which starts at no less than 4 weeks a year.
Bonuses are paid if you are working diligently toward your goal & not making it. Yearly review raises. Work, life balance is actually a priority not just talked about. When down sizing a position, they did it by Center not by capability. Managers should know how to do what you expect your staff to do in order for them to grow.

No flexibility, weak benefits for new employees, unable to work from home, executive leaders work at painstakingly slow speeds to sign off on advancements, at the time of publishing this review: it’s hard to respect this company as an employee due to settlements, cell phone service is next to none.

Wells Fargo,Online Business Customer Service Representative,"Excellent cafeteria and overall facility. Made coming to work quite enjoyable.
